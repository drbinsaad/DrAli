      "abstract": "Background Etiological factors affecting outcomes of cochlear implants (Cis) are known; however, a direct comparison of efficacy based on lesion location is needed. We aimed to systematically examine the current evidence to compare the effectiveness of CIs in patients with presynaptic versus postsynaptic neuropathy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Studies were selected based on their examination of CI efficacy in patients with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder, distinguishing between pre- and postsynaptic lesions using genetic markers or electrophysiological assessments. Results Analysis of seven studies consistently highlighted the importance of etiological diagnosis in predicting CI outcomes. Genetic mutations were correlated with more …",

      "title": "Nasal Dermoid Cyst with Sinus Tract Intranasal Bone: A Case Report",
      "year": 2024,
      "citation": "International Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery 13 (NO.2), 2024",
      "abstract": "Dermoid cysts are benign tumors originating from germ cells, which can form in various locations, including the nasal area in rare cases. They are of unknown exact etiology, but it is suggested that it is due to abnormal tissue migration during early embryonic development. Nasal dermoid cysts albeit rare, can present in various forms such as sinuses, fistulas, or intracranially extending tracts. They can be asymptomatic and incidentally discovered or present with a visible external mass or sinus that is either painful, infected or cosmetically concerning. If nasal dermoid cysts with an intra-nasal bone sinus tract are left untreated, they can lead to life-threatening complications. This report describes the case of a 6-year-old girl with a nasal dermoid cyst connected to a superficial punctum by an intra-nasal tract. She had undergone surgical excision of a nasal swelling previously diagnosed as a dermoid cyst. One year later, she returned to our clinic with a recurrence of the nasal swelling. Imaging tests revealed a nasal dermoid cyst with a tract extending to the nasal tip, without intracranial expansion. The cyst, along with the entire tract, was successfully removed surgically, and the postoperative follow-up indicated no complications. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. This case underscores the significance of considering the dermoid tract in nasal cyst cases and the necessity of its complete removal to prevent recurrence.",

      "year": 2022,
      "citation": "Cureus 14 (11), 2022",
      "abstract": "BackgroundFine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the gold standard for detecting thyroid nodules. It is a costefficient approach that affords prompt and accurate evaluation. It is crucial in deciding to treat patients with suspected malignancy of thyroid nodules that might have thyroid surgery. According to findings in cytology, patients may be observed when the cytology is benign, and surgery can be performed if the cytology is malignant, which leads to a reduction in the incidence of unneeded surgery.",

Antibiotics use after tonsillectomy is like any other surgical procedure; and it is thought that the antibiotic use may help to reduce post-operative morbidity.

      "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the patterns of video gaming among secondary school adolescents and to investigate their association with some risky behaviors.MATERIALS AND METHOS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 336 students randomly selected from secondary schools in Abha City, Saudi Arabia, during the academic year 2015–2016. A predesigned self-report questionnaire was used to assess students’ sociodemographic data, pattern, motivators and drawbacks of video gaming, previous academic year grades, history of violent acts, road traffic accidents (RTA), and violation of traffic rules. Weight and height were measured for every participant and BMI was calculated.RESULTS: About 80% of students played video games and 76% owned a video game machine. The median onset of video gaming was 10 years. The most important motivator for video gaming was ‘give a chance for fun and excitement’ (93.7%), followed by ‘give a chance to get rid of the boredom and leisure’ (92.3%). The most frequently reported social drawbacks were interfering with sleep time (69%), physical activity (64%), and meal time (59%). BMI was not significantly associated with the pattern of video game playing (P>0.05). Academic performance was significantly lower among students who used to game in cybercafes (P=0.001). Prevalence of tobacco smoking and some risky behaviors such as traffic rule violations, significant RTA, and violence were significantly more encountered among those preferring race and drift games (P<0.05) and used to game in cybercafes (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Video gaming among secondary school …",

No study has systematically described the pattern of foot  wounds among them. This observational study aimed to determine the spectrum of foot injuries among diabetic and non-diabetic Hajj pilgrims and the preventive measures adopted by them. Pilgrims who attended the Hajj 2013 and sought medical care for foot wounds at mobile podiatric clinics in  Mina during the peak days of Hajj were invited to participate in the study and fill out a questionnaire while they were serviced. Podiatric carers noted down the significant signs of foot injuries. Out of 197 pilgrims from 21 different countries who participated in this study, 60 (31%) were  diabetic. The two most common injuries observed were …",

      "abstract": "Unilateral cervical chondrocutanous branchial remnants (CCBRs) are uncommon, but when they do occur, they usually occur at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the lateral side of the neck, whereas normal skin with a cartilage core makes up the lesions. They have no deep underlying tissues; however, they frequently adhere to the sternocleidomastoid muscle fascia, Surgical excision is the preferred treatment for a CCBR. To rule out underlying significant anomalies, a comprehensive physical examination and ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen and heart are required.",
